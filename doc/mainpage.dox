\section Macros Defined for Doxygen

The following macros defined in the Doxyfile.
This is a work-around for a deficiency in the Doxygen preprocessor
Apparently doxygen doesn't understand <tt>defined ...</tt> (in config.h),
    so we've defined the other macros accordingly.

\code
  PRODUCT_ADBLOCKPLUS
  SUPPORT_FILTER
  SUPPORT_WHITELIST
  SUPPORT_DOM_TRAVERSER
  SUPPORT_FRAME_CACHING
\endcode
