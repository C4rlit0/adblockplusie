        Windows Installer uses a few pieces of information to manage its upgrade process.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Product ID</b>.
                This is a GUID that names a particular product release; it's the primary name.
                It has to be changed with each release.
                Within WiX, this is the attribute <code>Product/@Id</code>.
                Within the Windows Installer, this is the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa370854%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><code>ProductCode</code> property</a>.
                Caution: The property called <code>ProductID</code> in Windows Installer is called <code>Product/@Name</code> in WiX. 
            </li><li>
                <b>Version</b>.
                This is an informational field, which is dependent upon the Product ID.
                The version number is a dotted triple, with an optional fourth field.
                For comparison and equality, the first three fields are used and the fourth is ignored.
                Within WiX, this is the attribute <code>Product/@Version</code>.
                Within the Windows Installer, this is the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa370859%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><code>ProductVersion</code> property</a>. 
            </li><li>
                <b>Upgrade Code</b>.
                This GUID designates membership in a category that all may be upgraded by another, common package.
                Colloquially, it names what we would call the "Product", irrespective of revision.
                Technically, it's an identifier that allows one package to declare that it is able to supersede another package.
                Within WiX, this is the attribute <code>Product/@UpgradeCode</code>.
                Within the Windows Installer, this is the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa372375%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><code>UpgradeCode</code> property</a>. 
            </li><li>
                <b>Package ID</b>.
                This is a GUID that identifies a particular <code>.msi</code> file (in WI lingo, a particular package).
                Within WiX, this is the attribute <code>Product/Package/@Id</code>.
                Within the Windows Installer, this is called a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa370568%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">package code</a>.
                We never need to care about this, because the WiX syntax <code>Id="*"</code> generates unique identifiers each time.
                It's documented here in order to inform the reader that they may ignore it without peril.
            </li>
        </ul>
